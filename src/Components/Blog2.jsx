        Most living animal species are in Bilateria, a clade whose members have
        a bilaterally symmetric body plan. The Bilateria include the
        protostomes, containing animals such as nematodes, arthropods,
        flatworms, annelids and molluscs, and the deuterostomes, containing the
        echinoderms and the chordates, the latter including the vertebrates.
        Life forms interpreted as e
        arly animals were present in the Ediacaran
        biota of the late Precambrian. Many modern animal phyla became clearly
        established in the fossil record as marine species during the Cambrian
        explosion, which began around 539 million years ago. 6,331 groups of
        genes common to all living animals have been identified; these may have
        arisen from a single common ancestor that lived 650 million years ago.
